      <h2>Who is this Wealthy man?</h2>
      <h3> Back-ground</h3>
      <p>
        Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa.
        He attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.
        Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics.
        He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days to instead pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal; 
        the startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded the online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
        eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

      <h3>
        History
      </h3>

      <p>
        In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company,
        and is its CEO and chief engineer. 
        In 2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. 
        (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, 
        eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. 
        In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla 
        Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. 
        The following year, he co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer 
        interfaces—and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. 
        In 2022, Musk purchased the social media platform Twitter for $44 billion. 
        He has proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system, and is the president of the 
        philanthropic Musk Foundation.
       Musk has made controversial statements on politics and technology, particularly on Twitter, 
       and is a highly polarizing figure. He has also been criticized for making unscientific and misleading 
       statements, such as spreading COVID-19 misinformation. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
       Commission (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of 
       Tesla. Musk stepped down as chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine as part of a settlement 
       agreement with the SEC. Following his failed submarine proposal during the Tham Luang cave rescue, 
       Musk won a defamation case brought against him by a British caver involved in the operation.
